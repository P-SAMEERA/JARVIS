2,500 !! When multiplying 50 by 50, you need to find the sum of 50 added together 50 times. Or you can multiply each digit individually and then add the products. Either way, the answer is the same: 2,500.

Iron Man is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby. He first appeared in Tales of Suspense #39 (cover dated March 1963).

Tony Stark, a wealthy industrialist and brilliant engineer, undergoes a life-altering experience when he is gravely injured during an arms demonstration in Vietnam. As a prisoner of war, he constructs a powered exoskeleton to escape captivity. Upon his return to the United States, he refines the suit into a hi-tech weapon and becomes the armored superhero Iron Man.

Over the years, Iron Man has evolved both as a character and in his technology. He has been a founding member of the Avengers, a team of superheroes dedicated to protecting the Earth. He has also struggled with personal demons, including alcoholism and PTSD. However, through it all, he remains one of the most popular and iconic superheroes in the world.

Iron Man has been adapted into numerous other media, including animated series, video games, and live-action films. In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Iron Man was played by actor Robert Downey Jr., who portrayed the character in several films from 2008 to 2019.

Let's think step-by-step.
We define a function that takes two numbers.
We check if both numbers are positive using the condition "if a > 0 and b > 0:".
If both numbers are positive, we add them using the expression "a + b".
If either number is negative, we return a message indicating that we cannot add negative numbers.
Finally, we call the function with different inputs and print the results.
Here is the code:
```python
def add_two_numbers(a, b):
    if a > 0 and b > 0:
        return a + b
    else:
        return "Cannot add negative numbers"

print(add_two_numbers(3, 5))  # Output: 8
print(add_two_numbers(-3, -5))  # Output: Cannot add negative numbers
```
